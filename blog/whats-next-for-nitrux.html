							<p>So, the year is almost over, 2013 marked the first year Nitrux&#174; acted as a company, a small start-up in Mexico that begun as a hobby project about improving artwork in 
							Linux desktops. But it always meant something bigger, being located in a country where technology is hardly ever produced let alone being a focus of concern, the idea of making 
							a tech. start-up here was always met with such uninterest that it was amazing to see and believe. Very few were ever interested in hearing someone say something like that, a start 
							only met with obstacles and the lack of intention to even help much less being part of something that calls for being a big deal. Help? yeah, Nitrux&#174; eventually found the 
							people that comprises the small team in charge of carrying a company forward. Ideas, mails, mock-ups all sprung out of the interest of everyone involved.</p>
							
							<p>Throught the year ideas flowed into conceptualizing a new take for desktops computers. Desktops are far from gone, but they should evolve further to remain relevant. Wether it's 
							their hardware or their software, and that's something Nitrux&#174; wants to change. Speaking of changes, having experience the lack of interest in something that it's changing the 
							world around us inspired us to fix that. Technology doesn't have to be out of the reach for most people, it's hard to believe that not a single OEM company exists in the country, 
							it's even harder to believe that not a single software company exists producing consumer products. We're simply a one of a kind company in a place where what we want to do it's not 
							of the public's interest. Yet that didn't stopped us, that on the contrary is what gives us the strenght to carry on and fulfill our goals. Sure, a Mexican OEM sounds crazy, but hey, 
							it's a start. For 2014 we intend to develop our OS, Nitrux&#174; OS 2.0, and release it to the wild, we intend to make our - Backd - open-source funding program help those developers 
							that spend their free time making, building and maintaining their open-source projects by providing them financial backing where they have none. Because we didn't received the help
							we would've wanted to, but others don't have to go through the same.</p>
							
							<p>But how are we going to help those developers?, simple, we're going to take part of the money we as a company make and simply give it to them, yes, just give it to them like that, 
							because we believe that these people are already making a great job and not getting a reward for their job it's simply unfair. So we've committed ourselves to help fix that, thus enter 
							our NXQ&#174;. Out of the sales of the QtBox&#174; we'll give money to one open-source project, it doesn't matter whether the project is big or small. For every 4,000 USD that we make 
							out of the sales of our mini-PC we'll give 1,000 USD to a chosen open-source project for them to spend it on further developing it. The rules are simple, the projects will have to register 
							at our Backd site (http://backd.nitrux.in - site's not up at the time of this post), adding a small description for the project and a link to their website, up to 10 projects can enter the 
							program and then it's up to the users to vote, whatever projects wins will receive the funds, this will be repeated every 4,000 that we make from the QtBox&#174; sales, however projects can 
							only participate one time every year, that is if "XY" project won and received the 1,000 USD they can't participate again until the next year, so other projects have the opportunity to 
							receive the funds. If the following year a project who already won registers at Backd again and wins again said project will receive only 50 USD this is to avoid one project take an unfair
							advantage over others that need it more. To get the 1,000 again projects have to wait for one year after they've won the first time so if a project wins in 2018 it'll have to wait until 
							2020 to receive 1,000 USD again.</p>
							
							<p>It's important too that the projects that enter don't have any sponsorship already as it's not fair for those who don't. Funds will be given through ]PayPal so it's important to have a 
							verified account. What open-source projects qualify to enter Backd?:
								<ul>
									<li>Software</li>
									<li>Hardware</li>
									<li>Artwork</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							
							<p>So yeah, we're looking forward to 2014. If you have any questions you can send them here: contact@nitrux.in.</p>
