							<p>On this special blog post, I'll show you what's the process yours truly follows to design an icon for Nitrux&#174;. In the future this will be on the Developer area of the site 
							just so you know if you can't find it later on. Anyways, on this post I'll be making a Nitrux&#174; icon using Inkscape, this icon will be added to the large collection of mime-type 
							icons that we already provide and will set out a new styling for these icons. Let's start off with the obvious question, "why change it?", changes are good most of the times, and changes 
							are needed to progress in life, but changes have to make sense.</p>
							
							<p>With the release of Nitrux&#174; 3.0 the theme was absolutely and completely revamped (sans the mime-types), everything was done from scratch and with a whole new concept, dropping the 
							old Metro styling (which was mostly because I wasn't very good with Inkscape) to add much more detail, realism, fun and add a style of its own. I then started using grids, a colour palette,
							more gradients, and well, overall better designs. With version 3.1 the old mime-types had to go, as I didn't liked them anymore and I thought that they didn't represented the new vision I 
							had at all, so lo and behold the current icons. ast forward one year later and I'm faced with the same "issue", I don't like them anymore, and I don't think they represent the intended vision 
							and concept of the icons or that of Nitrux&#174; as a whole. What I'll do is to first open a random SVG from the icon theme in Inkscape, and while staring at it think why and what's wrong 
							with it. So let's use the icon for images as the example.</p>
							<br>

							</div>
							<br>
							</br>
							<p>So after about an hour of looking at the Inkscape window, my first thoughts are: "well, I don't like the gradient, though I like the purple/violet tone so I'll keep that, the white symbol/glyph 
							that simbolizes a picture or a couple of pictures is all messed up and certainly doesn't look like a panoramic photo of a mountain but I do like the idea of a photo or a polaroid type photo as a 
							symbolism for a mime-type that's associated with images but that folded paper overlay has to go, however since it's a mime-type and it's used for files, we'll use a folded corner instead something
							that's most likely going to get recognize as being a "file". Having clear the gradient and deleted the other elements I start off fresh, what's next you ask, well normally someone would say "I'm going 
							to sketch on a sheet of paper, then I'm going to scan it, and trace it", but that won't happen here one thing I can't do is draw, my hands aren't good at all at drawing, so we'll skip the sketching and 
							go straight into the Inkscape canvas. I'm aware this isn't how I'm "suppose" to do things, but it has saved me a lot of time, and paper. So to quickly start doing stuff I'll create a grid first, using the 
							square in the background to do this, afterwards I'll create a smaller grid using a smaller square (you don't say) and now we have our grid.</p>
							<br>
							</br>
							<div class="row">

								<header>
									<h3>This is how we know where to put stuff and how to keep it tidy</h3>
								</header>
							</div>
							<br>
							</br>
							<p> It's important to note that the icons are always at 48px, why 48? because it's somehow a magic number (it's the most used size on most cases in pretty much every UI I've used) and because if the icon looks 
							good at 48 it'll look good at 64, 96, 128, etc,. and it'll look good up even at 16px depending on the what we draw. Again, I know I'm supposed to make an icon for 16, 22 , 24, etc,. because of scaling, but 
							trust me 48 does magic and it saves time (and disk space by not adding lots of images for each size) also it's an SVG or in other words, it's efficient. Now comes the part where you want to know what to put in that 
							white square, but first let me introduce to this: the golden ratio. What's that?, well it's a number, and to avoid adding a block of text about it, let's just say that the number is present in nature and whatever 
							you do using it is going to be inherently beautiful, yeah science!. And why or how does it matter?, well take a look at the grid, as I mentioned the size is 48px but the smaller grid is 30px, why 30? because we've used 
							the golden ratio for it, we have substracted 18px from it because 18 is part of the secuence of numbers derived from 48. Yes more science. Now having said that, comes the part of what colors are we going to use, obvoiusly 
							this is important because (and this means more science) it's known that we remember much more easily stuff by association (colors, smells) than by names or words, so to not confuseusers with a whole new set of colors we're going 
							to use a similar but much more smoother gradient than what we had before, so it's still purple/violet but now it'll be a more coherent and consistent tone and that means it's easier to remember and associate.</p>
							<br>

									<h3><a href="http://goo.gl/TmzgsJ">Let's use a blue-violet lavanda color</a></h3>
								</header>
							</article>
							</div>
							<br>
							</br>
							<p> Having chosen our colors it's time to add the features of the icon, such as the folded corner. Now we know that paper is white for the most part but since white on white is obviously a bad idea we'll use another color. But first 
							let's decide where we want our folded corner to be, we'll put ours in the lower right corner and now since we don't want to be doing things at random we'll use another grid this time the size is going to be 14px, 14 being the combination 
							of 2 numbers from the sequence of 48 and those are 11 + 3. Having set our square at 14x14 on the lower right corner we proceed to cut it so it fits within the shape of the background that's going to cover, and afterwards we'll put a gradient 
							on it, to have a proper gradient we make sure that both ends of the tool are at the top and bottom exactly on the borders of our shape, for the color we'll use a very dark blue so it's neither black and contrasts enough with the white background 
							the icon is going to be used in. For reference we'll use this color for all mime-type icons in Nitrux&#174;.</p>
							<div class="row">
								<article class="12u special">
									<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic55.png" alt="" /></a>
									<header>
										<h3><a href="#">We'll use this gradient for the backround of the folded corner in every mime-type icon</a></h3>
									</header>
								</article>
							</div>
							<br>
							</br>
							<p>Next is the corner itself, using the pen we draw a triangle at the corner of the background using as reference the handles for the guides (the little red dots), and now we'll use the same gradient as the big background but with a twist, 
							so it gives the impression of being folded we want it to be at a different tone so we use light colors and add more stops to the gradient it's using then we cut the darker background using the triangle. The gradient is positioned diagonally to 
							provide perspective and depth for the icon.</p>
							<br>
							</br>
							<div class="row">
								<article class="12u special">
									<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic56.png" alt="" /></a>
									<header>
										<h3><a href="#">Cut, cut away</a></h3>
									</header>
								</article>
							</div>
							<br>
							</br>
							<p>To add more detail and depth we're going to add a shadow, this is simply rotate the triangle that was cut before and use a black to transparent black gradient and then move it next to the previous triangle. Again the gradient is oriented 
							diagonally.</p>
							<div class="row">
								<article class="12u special">
									<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic57.png" alt="" /></a>
									<header>
										<h3><a href="#">Add a nice shadow</a></h3>
									</header>
								</article>
							</div>
							<br>
							</br>
							<p>Then we move the 3 objects so that they're behind the borders of the icon. And now comes the difficult part: do the symbol. For this we'll go back to the icon we had before, in it we had an ugly symbol representing a panoramic picture of a mountain 
							so we're going to make another but this time using the golden ratio. First we fill the 30px grid with a completely squared shape, no round corners, then we go back to use the golden ratio and find a value which we can use to get the thicknes of what will 
							be the border of our photo, we'll use the number 3 (this is for all mime-types), then we'll make another square of 40.5px (again a combination of numbers from the sequence of 48), then using the handles for the guides we draw some squares and rectangles 
							(more numbers) inside the 40.5 grid and finally we'll have our grid for the mountains and the frame.</p>
							<br>
							</br>
							<div class="row">
								<article class="12u special">
									<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic58.png" alt="" /></a>
									<header>
										<h3><a href="#">Modern art, anyone?</a></h3>
									</header>
								</article>
							</div>
							<br>
							</br>
							<p> Now we simply use the pen tool to draw the mountains using our newly created grid.</p>
							<br>
							</br>
							<div class="row">
								<article class="12u special">
									<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic59.png" alt="" /></a>
									<header>
										<h3><a href="#">Now it's looking like something</a></h3>
									</header>
								</article>
							</div>
							<br>
							</br>
							<p>For the frame we'll simply cut the two squares.</p>
							<br>
							</br>
							<div class="row">
								<article class="12u special">
									<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic60.png" alt="" /></a>
									<header>
										<h3><a href="#">Looking good</a></h3>
									</header>
								</article>
							</div>
							<br>
							</br>
							<p> Next, we have to move the mountains so they fit the frame, for the inner frame we'll use a 22px square as a grid, moving the mountains inside of it at make them sit at the bottom of it, then we press Ctrl and +. To give them color we use the same 
							gradient we used in the background and we make it lighther, I use HSL for the tones to keep them more exact, then we add drop shadows by using our newly created symbol paint it black and add transparency, each step of the shadow using a different value, 
							then we add some depth and lightning to make it more realistic, and that's it.</p>
							<br>
							</br>
							<div class="row">
								  <article class="6u special">
									  <h1 class="image featured"><img src="images/pic51.png" alt="" /></h1>
									  <header>
										<h3>Yeah, sorry it didn't work out though, I'll call you</h3>
									  </header>
								  </article>
							<article class="6u special">

									  <header>
										<h3>What a beauty eh?, there's simply no comparison</h3>
									  </header>
							</article>
							</div>
							<br>
							</br>
							<p>So now you know what it takes to make <strong>one Nitrux&#174; icon</strong>, now repeat this process 400 times more and cover all the mime-type icons and more as we add them. We don't take our artwork lightly, so the next time you're using them, remember, 
							it may seem easy, but there's a whole lot of thought going on behind it and not just some pretty graphics, also remember that we <strong>absolutely do appreciate</strong> your support, be it through donations or by purchasing our items, as your love for good artwork 
							is what keeps us going.</p>
